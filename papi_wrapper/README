This papi wrapper provides customized groups of hardware performance counters 
by the aid of PAPI(Performance API). Few makefile variables are required to 
use this wrapper as below, and Makefile finds them from ../Defines.make 
in default. Please update Makefile accordingly when needed.

PAPI_DIR=#path to the installed PAPI 
PAPI_INC=$(PAPI_DIR)/include
PAPI_LIB=$(PAPI_DIR)/lib

Following is the list of groups supported:

MEASURE_TIME		
 & Measure execution time in micro seconds. Requires no hw ctr.
MEASURE_CPI			
 & Measure CPI. Requires two hw ctrs for nums of cycles and inst each.
MEASURE_MEMACC      
 & Measure number of loads and stores. Requires two hw ctrs.
MEASURE_LLCMISS		
 & Measure number of loads (and stores) misses of LLC cache. Requires a hw ctr.
MEASURE_ICACHEMISS
 & Measure number of L1 instruction cache misses. Requires a hw ctr.
MEASURE_DCACHEMISS
 & Measure numbers of L1 data cache misses and accesses. Requires two hw ctrs.
MEASURE_ENERGY
 & Measure all available RAPL events. The max num of RAPL ctrs is 64.

Note that there is a limited number of hw counters that can be counted 
at a run for each of processors architectures and names of hw performance 
counters are different as well. 
Following is the list of supported processor architectures by the papi wrapper.

__AMD_ABU_DHABI__
__INTEL_HASWELL__
__INTEL_SANDYBRIDGE__
__INTEL_IVYBRIDGE__
__ARMv7__


EXAMPLE OF USAGE
================

Pass,

-D__INTEL_IVYBRIDGE__ -DMEASURE_TIME -DMEASURE_CPI

as compile options when compiling papi wrapper if you want to measure
execution times and CPI on Intel Ivybridge processors. papi wrapper will complain
when the supported number of hw counters is not sufficient for the measurement.
